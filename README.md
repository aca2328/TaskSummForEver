# TaskSummForEver (Apple script)

## I wrote this tool to trac unfinished (= unchecked) tasks in Evernotes.

The script will browse all notes inside the choosen notebook to create a new note named "TaskSumm" with Hyperlink to each note that contain at least one unchecked Task.

The script can be converted into a app from the apple script editor
